# 🔥 DSA — _Data Structures & Algorithms 

> **Warning ⚠️:** If you're here to copy code without thinking... May your runtime errors be plenty and your segmentation faults untraceable 😎.

Welcome to the ultimate grind zone where **DSA meets discipline** and **C++ gets roasted into shape**. This repo is not just a collection of files — it's a timeline of sweat, bugs, caffeine, and late-night debugging breakdowns.

|--:|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | `1_Arrays`     | Basics of DSA — where everyone starts and most get rekt |
| 2 | `2_Vector`     | Dynamic arrays, because `new` and `delete` ain't fun |
| 3 | `3_Recursion`  | Function calls that call back, like your ex... recursively |
| 4 | `4_OOPS`       | Writing code like a boss (Objectively, of course) |
| 5 | `5_Pointers`   | The real gatekeeper — mess this and you’ll meet segfault hell |
| 6 | `6_linkedList` | Nodes and pointers doing the cha-cha slide |

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

Because copy-pasting from Leetcode won't make you a developer — **understanding will**. This is my personal DSA crash course from scratch, written, tested, debugged (and sometimes raged at) entirely in **C++**.

If it helps you, cool. If not, go touch grass 🌱.

## 💥 Final Words

> "DSA is not tough, your dedication is weak." — _Some wise coder_

So put on your debugging goggles, write some clean code, and **earn that AC**.
